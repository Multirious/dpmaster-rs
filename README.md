[dpmaster](https://github.com/kphillisjr/dpmaster/tree/master) protocol message serializing and deserializing

> Dpmaster is a lightweight master server written from scratch for DarkPlaces,
LordHavoc's game engine. It is an open master server because of its free source
code and documentation, and because its Quake III Arena-like protocol allows it
to fully support new games without having to restart or reconfigure it. In
addition to its own protocol, dpmaster also supports the master protocols of
"Quake III Arena" (Q3A), "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" (RtCW), and
"Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory" (WoET).
